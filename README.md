# ML-RandomForests-SVM
## Assignment
CS-5333 Project 2

## Authors
Andrew DeVoss and Jayson Garrison

## Project Description
### Random Forests
Using an ensemble of weak learners (small decision trees or stumps) model and classify labels based on their features. Compare the performances
of different information gain measurements (gini, entropy, and misclassification). Analyze the strength of a forest size of 50, 100, and 150 learners.
Consider different split point methods. Use five fold cross validation to verify the results.
### Support Vector Machines
Implement the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm that interprets the dual problem solution sequentially. Use five fold cross validation to verify the results.
## Data Sets Used
### Artifical
1. Linearly seperable points or blobs
2. Spiraled points
### Real
1. MNIST data set of handwritten digits
2. Spam/ham email data set

#### Use of Principal Component Analysis
- Used PCA to reduce the dimesion of image and mail features to improve classification.

## What I (Jayson) have learned
### Languages
I continued my usage of Python from the [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/jayson-garrison/ML-Naive-Bayes) project and gained proficiency. 
### Development
- Linux based development
- Anaconda to manage several packages
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
### Machine Learning
- Constructed decision trees
- Implemented a random forest model to predict classifications
- Utilized three different information gain measures to determine split points
- Explained the Fundamental Optimization Problem in SVMs
- Implemented the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm
- Visualized data
- Verified testing and training accuracy using five fold cross validation
- Evaluated the importance of data representation and feature relevancy
### Packages
 - NumPy
 - Matplotlib
 - Pandas
### Insight
