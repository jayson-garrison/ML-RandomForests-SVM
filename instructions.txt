You will implement and experiment with (a) a random forest and (b) a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
with datasets from your first project and the additional datasets provided for this project.  
You can work in groups of 2 for this project.   One of the two algorithm implementation and report 
must be submitted by the end of next week and the implementation of the other algorithm as well as 
the combined report is due by the deadline specified.

The dataset.zip file includes two 2-D datasets, corresponding visualizations, and a python script to 
generate your own dataset.

The double spirals data generator is a python version of function "mlbench.spirals" from R package 
"mlbench". A simple documentation can be found: 
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mlbench/versions/2.1-1/topics/mlbench.spirals

The blobs data generator is based on multivariate normal distribution. It can generate high-dimensional dataset.
The current code will generate balanced datasets, you could under/over-sample some classes to get an imbalanced one.
